### Overview
In this project, we will create an webpage contain three interactive chart to show the BellyButton Biodiversity information. The webpage will contain three graphs: a bar chart, a guage chart and a bubble chart. The top ten bacteria cultures found based on subject ID will shown in the bar chart. The gauge chart will indicate the washing frequency, and the bubble chart will show the bactera cultures found per sample.

## Result
### Bar Chart
As shown below, when changing the subject ID from the dropdown menue, the demographc information of a person shown in the left side. The bar chart display the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the sample.

### Bubble Chart
The bubble chart as shown below displays the bacteria cultures found in different sample. The x axis contain our OTU ids, while the y axis display the sample_values. The marker size are determined by the sample_values as well. The color scale is "Earth", and the color of the marker is based on the OTU ids.
